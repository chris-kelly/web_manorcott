			"I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Jonathan Holder to any person or organisation wishing to engage the services of a top quality media lawyer.  Jonathan has all the attributes required to perform to the very highest standard any legal, business affairs or corporate/ commercial task that an organisation involved in the media or related industries might need fulfilling.  Jonathan has held  and excelled in key positions with major broadcasters and distributors and, since he set up his own consultancy business, has been a highly valued consultant to broadcasters producers and other media players alike."<br><br>
			"I am very well placed to opine on Jonathan’s abilities having employed him as the first member of my team and my  highly trusted right hand man and worked very closely with him over a period of 12 years in the 1980s and 1990s; worked alongside him for three years in the mid-1990s when we were both at the 
			BBC and having engaged his services on a consultancy basis when I was 
			Director of Legal and Business affairs at Channel Five which I was for 10 years from 1997 whenever 
			I was able to do so and had a legal/business affairs or commercial task to be undertaken by a highly experienced, commercially astute, gifted, hard-working and totally reliable media lawyer."<br></p>
